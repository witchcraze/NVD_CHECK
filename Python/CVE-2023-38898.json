        "Descriptions": "An issue in Python cpython v.3.7 allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information via the _asyncio._swap_current_task component. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because (1) neither 3.7 nor any other release is affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-releases); (2) there are no common scenarios in which an adversary can call _asyncio._swap_current_task but does not already have the ability to call arbitrary functions; and (3) there are no common scenarios in which sensitive information, which is not already accessible to an adversary, becomes accessible through this bug.",
