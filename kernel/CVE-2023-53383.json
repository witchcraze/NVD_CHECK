        "Descriptions": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nirqchip/gicv3: Workaround for NVIDIA erratum T241-FABRIC-4\n\nThe T241 platform suffers from the T241-FABRIC-4 erratum which causes\nunexpected behavior in the GIC when multiple transactions are received\nsimultaneously from different sources. This hardware issue impacts\nNVIDIA server platforms that use more than two T241 chips\ninterconnected. Each chip has support for 320 {E}SPIs.\n\nThis issue occurs when multiple packets from different GICs are\nincorrectly interleaved at the target chip. The erratum text below\nspecifies exactly what can cause multiple transfer packets susceptible\nto interleaving and GIC state corruption. GIC state corruption can\nlead to a range of problems, including kernel panics, and unexpected\nbehavior.\n\n>From the erratum text:\n  \"In some cases, inter-socket AXI4 Stream packets with multiple\n  transfers, may be interleaved by the fabric when presented to ARM\n  Generic Interrupt Controller. GIC expects all transfers of a packet\n  to be delivered without any interleaving.\n\n  The following GICv3 commands may result in multiple transfer packets\n  over inter-socket AXI4 Stream interface:\n   - Register reads from GICD_I* and GICD_N*\n   - Register writes to 64-bit GICD registers other than GICD_IROUTERn*\n   - ITS command MOVALL\n\n  Multiple commands in GICv4+ utilize multiple transfer packets,\n  including VMOVP, VMOVI, VMAPP, and 64-bit register accesses.\"\n\n  This issue impacts system configurations with more than 2 sockets,\n  that require multi-transfer packets to be sent over inter-socket\n  AXI4 Stream interface between GIC instances on different sockets.\n  GICv4 cannot be supported. GICv3 SW model can only be supported\n  with the workaround. Single and Dual socket configurations are not\n  impacted by this issue and support GICv3 and GICv4.\"\n\n\nWriting to the chip alias region of the GICD_In{E} registers except\nGICD_ICENABLERn has an equivalent effect as writing to the global\ndistributor. The SPI interrupt deactivate path is not impacted by\nthe erratum.\n\nTo fix this problem, implement a workaround that ensures read accesses\nto the GICD_In{E} registers are directed to the chip that owns the\nSPI, and disable GICv4.x features. To simplify code changes, the\ngic_configure_irq() function uses the same alias region for both read\nand write operations to GICD_ICFGR.",
